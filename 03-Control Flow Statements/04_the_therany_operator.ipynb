    "In this example, the ternary operator is used to assign a value to the variable result based on the condition num > 0. If the condition is True, the value \"Positive\" is assigned to result; otherwise, the value \"Non-positive\" is assigned. The value of result is then printed, which will be either \"Positive\" or \"Non-positive\" depending on the value of num.\n",

    "The ternary operator can be used to simplify the code and make it more readable in cases where you need to assign a value based on a simple condition. However, it's important to use it judiciously and avoid nesting multiple ternary operators, as it can make the code less understandable.\n",

    "In this part, you learned about the ternary operator in Python. The ternary operator provides a concise way to write simple conditional statements and assign a value based on a condition. It can make the code more readable and compact in certain situations. However, it's important to use it sparingly and avoid excessive nesting to maintain code clarity."
