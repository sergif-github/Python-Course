# Exercise 8
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter their first name and last name separately. Concatenate the two strings
# and print the full name.


# Exercise 9
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a sentence and calculates the length of the sentence. Print the length.


# Exercise 10
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a sentence and a word to search. Count the number of occurrences
# of the word in the sentence and print the count.


# Exercise 11
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a word and stores it in a variable called `word`. Access the first character
# of the word and print it.


# Exercise 12
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a sentence and stores it in a variable called `sentence`. Use string slicing
# to print the first three characters of the sentence.


# Exercise 13
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a word. Use string slicing to extract the first three characters,
# the last three characters, and a substring starting from the fourth character up to the end of the word. Print the extracted substrings.


# Exercise 14
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a word. Reverse the word using string slicing and print the reversed word.


# Exercise 15
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a word and stores it in a variable called `word`. Use the `upper()` method
# to convert the word to uppercase and print the result.


# Exercise 16
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a sentence. Convert the sentence to lowercase and print the result.


# Exercise 17
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a sentence. Split the sentence into a list of words using the `split()` method.
# Print the list of words.


# Exercise 18
# Write a Python program that defines two boolean variables `is_raining` and `is_sunny`. Assign appropriate values to these variables
# based on the weather conditions. Print the values of the variables.


# Exercise 19
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter their age. Compare their age to a predefined adult age (e.g., 18) using
# the greater than operator (`>`). Print whether the user is an adult or not based on the comparison result.


# Exercise 20
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number. Check if the number is a positive number greater than 10 using boolean
# comparison (`>`) and logical operators (`and`). Print the result of the check.


# Exercise 21
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number. Check if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 using
# the logical AND operator (`and`). Print the result of the check.


# Exercise 22
# Write a Python program that defines three boolean variables: `is_student`, `has_homework`, and `is_weekend`. Assign appropriate values
# to these variables. Write a conditional statement using logical operators (`and`, `or`) to determine if the student has to do homework. Print the result.


# Exercise 23
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter an integer. Convert the integer to a string using the `str()` function and assign it to a variable.
# Print the type of the variable.


# Exercise 24
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a string containing a number. Convert the string to an integer using the `int()` function
# and assign it to a variable. Print the type of the variable.


# Exercise 25
# Write a Python program that defines a float number. Convert the float number to an integer using the `int()` function and assign it to a variable.
# Print the type of the variable.


# Exercise 26
# Create an empty list called my_list. Add the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the list. Remove the number 3 from the list.
# Print the final contents of the list.


# Exercise 27
# Create a tuple called my_tuple with the values 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', and 'date'. Access the second element of the tuple and print it.


# Exercise 28
# Create two sets: set1 with the values 1, 2, 3, and 4, and set2 with the values 3, 4, 5, and 6. Print the union of set1 and set2.
# Print the intersection of set1 and set2.


# Exercise 29
# Create a dictionary called my_dict with the keys 'name', 'age', and 'city' and their corresponding values.Print the value associated
# with the key 'age'. Add a new key 'country' with the value 'USA' to the dictionary. Print the updated dictionary.


# Exercise 30 Create a dictionary called student_scores with the keys 'Alice', 'Bob', and 'Charlie' and their corresponding values
# as the scores (out of 100). Calculate the average score of the students and store it in a variable called average_score. Print the average score.
