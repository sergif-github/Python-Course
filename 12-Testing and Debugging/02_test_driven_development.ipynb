    "\n",
    "Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where test cases are written before writing the actual code. \n",
    "The TDD process follows these steps:\n",
    "- Write a test case: Begin by writing a test case that defines the expected behavior of the code you want to implement.\n",
    "This test case should initially fail since the code does not exist yet.\n",
    "- Run the test: Run the test case and verify that it fails. This confirms that the test is indeed checking the behavior you want to implement.\n",
    "- Write the code: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the failing test pass. The focus is on making the test case pass and nothing more. \n",
    "- Run the test again: Rerun the test case to validate that the code change made in the previous step has made the test pass.\n",
    "- Refactor the code (if needed): If the code is working correctly and the test case is passing, you can refactor the code to improve its design, \n",
    "- readability, or performance. This step ensures that the code maintains its correctness while undergoing changes. \n",
    "- Repeat: Repeat the process by writing a new test case for the next desired behavior and continue the cycle of writing code, running tests, \n",
    "- and refactoring until all desired behaviors are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following the TDD approach, you can ensure that your code is designed to meet specific requirements and that it remains functional even as you make changes. TDD encourages a testable and modular code structure, promotes better code quality, and helps catch issues early in the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD is often implemented using testing frameworks such as unittest in Python, which provide a framework for writing and running tests. The unittest module supports TDD by allowing you to write test cases and assertions that drive the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the TDD process using the unittest module:"

    "In this example, we want to implement the add() method in the MathUtils class. We start by writing a test case for the addition behavior. The test case checks if the add() method returns the correct sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the test case will fail because the add() method is not yet implemented. Following the TDD process, we then write the minimal code necessary to make the test pass. In this case, it involves implementing the add() method to return the sum of two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing the code, we rerun the test case and validate that it passes. If the test case passes, we can proceed to refactor the code if necessary or continue with the next test case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test-Driven Development promotes a systematic approach to development by focusing on writing tests before writing code. It helps ensure that the code meets the desired requirements, encourages modular and testable code, and reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs during development.\n",

TDD involves writing tests before writing the actual code and following a cycle of writing code, running tests, and refactoring. TDD promotes better code quality, ensures code functionality, and helps catch issues early in the development process.\n",
