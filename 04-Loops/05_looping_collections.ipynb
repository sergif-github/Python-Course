    "In Python, you can use loops to iterate through collections such as lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries. This allows you to access \n",

    "\n",
    "### 5.1. Looping Through Lists and Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "To loop through a list or tuple, you can use the `for` loop in conjunction with the collection name. Here's an example:"
