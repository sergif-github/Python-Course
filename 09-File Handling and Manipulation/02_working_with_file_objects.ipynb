    "\n",
    "In addition to reading and writing text files, Python provides several methods and attributes that can be used to work with file objects.\n",

    "### 2.1 File Object Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "File objects in Python come with various methods that allow you to perform operations on the file. Here are some commonly used methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `read(size)`: Reads and returns `size` bytes from the file. If `size` is not specified, it reads the entire file.\n",
    "- `readline()`: Reads and returns the next line from the file.\n",
    "- `readlines()`: Reads all lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings.\n",
    "- `write(string)`: Writes the specified `string` to the file.\n",
    "- `writelines(lines)`: Writes a list of strings `lines` to the file.\n",
    "- `seek(offset)`: Changes the file position to the given `offset` (in bytes).\n",
    "- `tell()`: Returns the current file position.\n",
    "- `close()`: Closes the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of some of these methods:"
