    "## Part 3: Exploring the Python Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Standard Library is a rich collection of modules and packages that come bundled with the Python installation. \n",
    "It provides a wide range of functionalities to help you accomplish various tasks without having to reinvent the wheel. \n",
    "In this section, we will explore some of the commonly used modules from the Python Standard Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Using Standard Library Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a module from the Python Standard Library, you need to import it using the `import` statement. Here are a few examples\n",
    "of popular modules and how to import them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `os`: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as file and directory operations.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import os\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `datetime`: Offers classes and methods for working with dates and times.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import datetime\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `random`: Enables generating random numbers and making random selections.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import random\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `math`: Provides mathematical functions and constants.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import math\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `json`: Offers functions for working with JSON data.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import json\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `csv`: Allows reading and writing CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import csv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples, and there are many more modules available in the Python Standard Library to suit different \n",
    "needs and requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Exploring Module Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a module from the Python Standard Library, it's essential to consult its documentation to understand its available \n",
    "functionalities and how to use them effectively. The official Python documentation provides detailed information on each module,\n",
    "including the classes, functions, and constants it offers, along with usage examples and explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the Python Standard Library documentation online at [https://docs.python.org/](https://docs.python.org/) or by using \n",
    "the `help()` function within the Python interpreter. For example, to get help on the `os` module, you can run the following code:"
