# Module 3: Operators

## Part 1: Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric operands. 

### 1.1 Arithmetic operators

Python provides several arithmetic operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

#### Addition Operator (+)

The addition operator (`+`) is used to add two numbers together. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = 3

result = x + y  # 5 + 3 = 8
print("Result:", result)  # Output: Result: 8
```

#### Subtraction Operator (-)

The subtraction operator (-) is used to subtract one number from another. For example:

```python
x = 10
y = 3

result = x - y  # 10 - 3 = 7
print("Result:", result)  # Output: Result: 7
```

#### Multiplication Operator (*)

The multiplication operator (*) is used to multiply two numbers. For example:

```python
x = 4
y = 5

result = x * y  # 4 * 5 = 20
print("Result:", result)  # Output: Result: 20
```

#### Division Operator (/)

The division operator (/) is used to divide one number by another. In Python 3.x, the division operator always returns a float result, even if the operands are integers. For example:

```python
x = 10
y = 3

result = x / y  # 10 / 3 = 3.3333333333333335
print("Result:", result)  # Output: Result: 3.3333333333333335
```

#### Floor Division Operator (//)

The floor division operator (//) is used to perform integer division. It returns the largest possible integer quotient without considering the remainder. For example:

```python
x = 10
y = 3

result = x // y  # 10 // 3 = 3
print("Result:", result)  # Output: Result: 3
```

#### Modulus Operator (%)

The modulus operator (%) is used to find the remainder of the division between two numbers. For example:

```python
x = 10
y = 3

result = x % y  # 10 % 3 = 1
print("Result:", result)  # Output: Result: 1
```

#### Exponentiation Operator (**)

The exponentiation operator (**) is used to raise a number to the power of another number. For example:

```python
x = 2
y = 3
```
result = x ** y  # 2 ** 3 = 8
print("Result:", result)  # Output: Result: 8

### 1.2 Summary

In this part, you explored the arithmetic operators in Python, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, modulus, and exponentiation. These operators are essential for performing mathematical operations in your programs.
