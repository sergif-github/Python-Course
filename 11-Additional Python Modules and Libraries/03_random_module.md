## Part 3: Generating Random Numbers (random module)

Python provides the `random` module, which allows you to generate random numbers and perform various randomization operations. 
This module is useful in applications that require randomization, such as games, simulations, and statistical analysis.

### 3.1 Random module

To use the `random` module, you need to import it. Here's an example:

```python
import random

# Generate a random integer within a specific range
random_integer = random.randint(1, 10)
print("Random Integer:", random_integer)

# Generate a random floating-point number between 0 and 1
random_float = random.random()
print("Random Float:", random_float)

# Generate a random floating-point number within a specific range
random_range = random.uniform(0.5, 2.5)
print("Random Range:", random_range)

# Select a random element from a sequence
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango"]
random_fruit = random.choice(fruits)
print("Random Fruit:", random_fruit)

# Shuffle the elements of a sequence randomly
random.shuffle(fruits)
print("Shuffled Fruits:", fruits)
```

In this example, we import the random module and use it to perform various randomization operations. Here's what each step does:
- We generate a random integer using the randint() function, which takes a lower bound and an upper bound and returns a random integer within that range.
- We generate a random floating-point number between 0 and 1 using the random() function.
- We generate a random floating-point number within a specific range using the uniform() function, which takes a lower bound 
and an upper bound and returns a random float within that range.
- We select a random element from a sequence using the choice() function, which takes a sequence and returns a random element from it.
- We shuffle the elements of a sequence randomly using the shuffle() function, which takes a sequence and shuffles its elements randomly.

### 3.2 Summary

The random module provides many more functions for generating random numbers and performing randomization operations. You can refer 
to the official Python documentation for a comprehensive list of functions available in the random module.
