    "### 3.1. Statements and Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, statements are instructions or commands that perform specific actions. Each statement typically occupies a single line,\n",
    "but you can extend a statement across multiple lines using line continuation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "A line of code in Python is terminated by a newline character. However, you can use a backslash () at the end of a line\n",
    "to indicate that the statement continues on the next line.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, indentation plays a crucial role in defining the structure and scope of code blocks. Unlike other programming languages\n",
    "that use braces or keywords, Python uses consistent indentation to indicate the beginning and end of blocks.\n",
    "Indentation is typically done using spaces or tabs, but it's essential to be consistent throughout your code. \n",
    "The standard recommendation is to use four spaces for each indentation level.\n",
