    "However, in Python 3, the division operator performs true division, returning a float. To achieve integer division in Python 3,\n",
    "you can use the // operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Print as a Function\n",
    "    \n",
    "   In Python 3, print became a function rather than a statement, requiring parentheses. \n",
    "   This change allows for more flexibility in terms of specifying separators, end characters, and output streams. \n",
    "   In Python 2, the print statement did not require parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Iteration and Looping\n",
    "\n",
    "    The range() function in Python 3 returns an iterator instead of a list, which improves performance\n",
    "and memory usage for large ranges. In Python 2, the range() function returns a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Python 2, the except statement allowed catching multiple exceptions in a single block, \n",
    "whereas Python 3 introduced a more explicit syntax that requires listing each exception separately. This change improves code clarity and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transition from Python 2 to Python 3\n",
    "Python 3 was introduced to address the limitations of Python 2 and improve the overall language design. However, \n",
    "due to backward compatibility concerns, the adoption of Python 3 was initially slow. This resulted in a period where both \n",
    "Python 2 and Python 3 were widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To encourage the transition from Python 2 to Python 3, a deprecation timeline was established. \n",
    "Python 2 reached its end of life (EOL) on January 1, 2020, and is no longer actively maintained or updated. \n",
    "Python 3, on the other hand, continues to receive updates, improvements, and new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For new projects, it is recommended to use Python 3 to take advantage of its improved features, bug fixes, and the larger\n",
    "ecosystem of libraries and tools that support Python 3. However, for legacy projects or systems still dependent on Python 2,\n",
    "there are tools available, such as 2to3, that can assist in migrating code to Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 offers numerous benefits and enhancements over Python 2, making it the preferred version for new development.\n",
    "As the Python community continues to evolve and embrace Python 3, it is essential to understand the differences and benefits\n",
    "to make informed decisions about using the appropriate version of Python for your projects.\n",
    "\n",
