    "## Part 2: Iterators and Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, iteration is a powerful concept that allows you to iterate over objects using the `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators and generators are powerful concepts in Python that allow for efficient and memory-friendly handling of large\n",
    "datasets or infinite sequences of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Iterators\n",
    "\n",
    "The iteration protocol consists of two methods: `__iter__()` and `__next__()`. By implementing these methods, you can make an object\n",
    "iterable and define how it behaves during iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol. It allows you to iterate over a collection of elements or values one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `__iter__()` method is responsible for returning an iterator object. It is called when you start iterating over an object. \n",
    "- This method initializes any necessary state and returns an iterator object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `__next__()` method is called on the iterator object and is responsible for returning the next value in the iteration. \n",
    "- It should raise the `StopIteration` exception when there are no more values to be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing the iteration protocol, you can create custom iterable objects and define their iteration behavior. \n",
    "This allows you to control how the objects are iterated over and what values are returned during each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the iteration protocols is essential for building advanced iterable objects and working with custom iterators and generators in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of creating a custom iterator for a list of numbers:"

    "which returns the iterator object itself, and the __next__() method, which retrieves the next value from the list. When there \n",
    "are no more values to iterate over, we raise a StopIteration exception. We can then use the NumberIterator object in a for loop to iterate over each number in the list.\n",
