    "\n",
    "Python provides a built-in debugger called pdb (Python Debugger), which allows you to step through your code, inspect variables, and track the flow of execution.\n",
    "To use the pdb debugger, you need to import the pdb module and add a breakpoint in your code at the point where you want the debugger to start. \n",
    "Here's an example:"

    "In this example, we import the pdb module and add a pdb.set_trace() statement at the desired breakpoint. When the code execution reaches\n",
    "this point, it will pause, and the debugger prompt will appear. From here, you can interact with the debugger using various commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful pdb commands include:\n",
    "- n (next): Execute the next line of code.\n",
    "- s (step): Step into a function call.\n",
    "- c (continue): Continue execution until the next breakpoint or the end of the program.\n",
    "- l (list): Show the current code around the breakpoint.\n",
    "- p (print): Print the value of a variable.\n",
    "- q (quit): Quit the debugger and terminate the program.\n",

    "### 4.2 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the debugger, you can execute code line by line, inspect variable values, and identify the source of errors or unexpected behavior \n",
    "in your code. Debugging with the pdb debugger can significantly improve your ability to troubleshoot and resolve issues in your Python programs. \n",
    "It is recommended to practice using the debugger regularly to become proficient in debugging complex code.\n",

    "Remember to practice debugging regularly, experiment with different scenarios, and become comfortable with the debugger's commands and features. \n",
    "With time and experience, you will become more proficient in debugging and be able to resolve issues more efficiently."
