# Python-learn

This repo is just for learning purpose.

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose, and cross-platform programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989. It is used to develop different types of applications such as web applications, desktop software, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation. It is one of the most popular languages ​​in the development community due to its easy and readable syntax, large number of available libraries and resources, and ease of learning.

Python is an interpreted programming language. In this case we need an interpreter in charge of reading the source code, interpreting it and executing it. As opposed to compiled languages ​​like C or C++ where code is translated into machine code through a compiler before being executed. The interpreted language allows us more flexibility although it generally tends to be slower and less secure than the compiled language. Python has its own default interpreter called "Python iterpreter". It can be executed from the command line and is the one used by different IDEs by default. Additionally, there are other interpreters such as IPython and Jupyter that provide more interactivity and "shell-like" and "notebook-like" environments to run Python code.

The development environments (IDEs) most used to develop Python are: PyCharm, Spyder, Eclipse with the PyDev plugin, Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook. Among its large number of libraries, the following stand out: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch.

This repository uses Python 3.9.7 and the PyCharm IDE.
