# Python Course Repository

Welcome to the Python Course repository! This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive Python programming course for beginners. 
Whether you're new to programming or have some experience, this course will help you learn and improve your Python skills.

Python is a programming language which is very close to human language and because of that it is easy to learn and use.
Python is used by various industries and companies. It has been used to develop web applications, desktop applications,
system adminstration, and machine learning libraries. Python is highly embraced language in the data science and machine learning community.
I hope this is enough to convince you to start learning Python. Python is eating the world and you are killing it before it eats you.

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose, and cross-platform programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989.
It is used to develop different types of applications such as web applications, desktop software, data analysis, artificial intelligence,
and automation. It is one of the most popular languages in the development community due to its easy and readable syntax,
large number of available libraries and resources, and ease of learning.

Python is an interpreted programming language. In this case we need an interpreter in charge of reading the source code,
interpreting it and executing it. As opposed to compiled languages like C or C++ where code is translated into 
machine code through a compiler before being executed. The interpreted language allows us more flexibility although it generally
tends to be slower and less secure than the compiled language. Python has its own default interpreter called "Python iterpreter".

Python can be executed from the command line and is the one used by different IDEs by default. Additionally, there are other interpreters
such as IPython and Jupyter that provide more interactivity and "shell-like" and "notebook-like" environments to run Python code.
The development environments (IDEs) most used to develop Python are: PyCharm, Spyder, Eclipse with the PyDev plugin, 
Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook. Among its large number of libraries, the following stand out: NumPy, Pandas, 
Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch.

This repository uses Python 3.9.7 and the PyCharm IDE.

Happy coding and enjoy the Python course!

## Course Overview

This Python course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of programming using the Python programming language. 
The course covers a wide range of topics, starting from the basics and gradually progressing to more advanced concepts.

Here are some of the key topics covered in this course:

- Basic objects, statements, and data types
- Methods and functions
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
- Modules and packages
- Exception handling
- Built-in functions and standard library
- Decorators
- Generators and iterators
- Working with images

The course is structured in a way that each topic builds upon the previous ones, providing a logical progression of learning. 
Each topic includes theory explanations, practical examples, and exercises to reinforce your understanding.

The goal of this course is to cover foundational aspects of Python programming with an emphasis on script writing,
basic data manipulation, and program organization.  By the end of this course, students should be able to start writing 
useful Python programs on their own or be able to understand and modify Python code written by their coworkers.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Python course, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- A basic understanding of programming concepts (though no prior experience with Python is required)
- Python installed on your local machine (preferably >= Python 3.6)

To install Python, you can visit the official Python website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and follow the installation
instructions specific to your operating system.

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-course.git
```
