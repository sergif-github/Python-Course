## About Python

Python is a programming language which is very close to human language and because of that it is easy to learn and use.
Python is used by various industries and companies. It has been used to develop web applications, desktop applications,
system administration, and machine learning libraries. Python is highly embraced language in the data science and machine learning community.
I hope this is enough to convince you to start learning Python. Python is eating the world and you are killing it before it eats you.

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose, and cross-platform programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989.
It is used to develop different types of applications such as web applications, desktop software, data analysis, artificial intelligence,
and automation. It is one of the most popular languages in the development community due to its easy and readable syntax,
large number of available libraries and resources, and ease of learning.

Python is an interpreted programming language. In this case we need an interpreter in charge of reading the source code,
interpreting it and executing it. As opposed to compiled languages like C or C++ where code is translated into 
machine code through a compiler before being executed. The interpreted language allows us more flexibility although it generally
tends to be slower and less secure than the compiled language. Python has its own default interpreter called "Python interpreter".

Python can be executed from the command line and is the one used by different IDEs by default. Additionally, there are other interpreters
such as IPython and Jupyter that provide more interactivity and "shell-like" and "notebook-like" environments to run Python code.
The development environments (IDEs) most used to develop Python are: PyCharm, Spyder, Eclipse with the PyDev plugin, 
Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook. Among its large number of libraries, the following stand out: NumPy, Pandas, 
Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch.


## Getting Started

In this course, you have the flexibility to choose between using JupyterLab or an IDE with a Python installation, or opting for the convenience
of Google Colab without any local installations. Both options provide powerful environments for writing, executing, and collaborating on code.

If you already have Python installed and prefer to work locally, JupyterLab or an IDE will offer a seamless coding experience. On the other hand,
if you prefer a cloud-based environment, Google Colab will provide you with the necessary tools and resources.

Feel free to choose the option that best suits your preferences and needs. Throughout the course, we will provide instructions and examples
that are compatible with both setups.

Now that you have the necessary information to get started, let's embark on this exciting learning journey together!


### Python Installation (for JupyterLab and IDEs)

If you prefer using an IDE or JupyterLab on your local machine, it's essential to have Python installed. 
Python serves as the foundation for running JupyterLab and executing Python code. 

Follow these steps to install Python:

1. Check if Python is already installed by running ```python --version``` command.
    If Python is already installed, you will see the installed version. If not, continue to the next step.

2. Install Python
    To install Python, visit the official Python website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Choose the appropriate installer 
for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and follow the installation instructions.

    During the installation, make sure to select the option to add Python to your system's PATH variable. This will make it easier to access Python
from the command prompt or terminal.


### Choose between Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide a comprehensive environment for writing, editing, and running Python code.
IDEs offer features such as code completion, debugging tools, and project management capabilities, making them popular among 
developers for efficient and productive coding.

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

    Visual Studio Code, commonly referred to as VS Code, is a popular open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. 
It offers a wide range of extensions and a vibrant community, making it a powerful choice for Python development.

    Install VS Code from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com/).


- **PyCharm**

    PyCharm is a professional Python IDE developed by JetBrains. It offers a rich set of features specifically designed for Python development,
including intelligent code completion, debugging tools, and support for various frameworks.

  Download and install PyCharm Community Edition (free) or PyCharm Professional Edition (commercial) from the JetBrains website (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).


- **Atom**

    Atom is a customizable and hackable text editor developed by GitHub. It offers a vast ecosystem of packages and themes, 
making it a popular choice for Python developers who prefer flexibility and extensibility.

    Install Atom from the official website (https://atom.io/).

These are just a few examples of the many IDEs available for Python development. Each IDE has its own set of features and workflows,
so feel free to explore and choose the one that best fits your needs and preferences.

By using an IDE, you can streamline your Python development process, benefit from advanced code editing capabilities, 
and boost your productivity as a Python programmer. You will need to install extensions to work with .ipynb files used in this course.
On the other hand, you can use JupyterLab or Google Cloab.

- **JupyterLab**

    JupyterLab is a powerful interactive development environment that allows you to create and run Jupyter notebooks, code, and markdown files. 

    Install JupyterLab with ```pip install jupyterlab``` command. Wait for the installation to complete. 
Once done, JupyterLab should be installed on your system.

    Launch JupyterLab by running the following command: ```jupyter lab```. This will open JupyterLab in your default web browser.

### Google Colab (No Installations Required)

Alternatively, if you prefer a hassle-free setup without any installations on your local machine, you can utilize Google Colab. 
Google Colab provides a cloud-based environment where you can create, run, and collaborate on Jupyter notebooks without the need for local installations.
Google Colab provides pre-installed libraries, including Python and popular data science packages like NumPy and Pandas. You can directly write
and execute code in the notebook cells.

To access Google Colab:

1. Open Google Colab: Visit the Google Colab website using any web browser.
2. Create a New Notebook: Click on "New Notebook" to create a new blank notebook or choose from existing templates.


### Files used

In this course, we have chosen .ipynb files as the primary format to provide an interactive and comprehensive learning experience. 
The course material, including code examples, exercises, and project templates, will be provided as Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files).

You can open and run the .ipynb files using JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, or other compatible environments. These tools offer an interactive
interface where you can execute code cells, modify the code, add your own notes, and visualize the results.

By using .ipynb files, we aim to provide an engaging and hands-on learning experience that combines code, documentation, and visualization,
allowing you to grasp concepts more effectively and apply them in practical scenarios.
