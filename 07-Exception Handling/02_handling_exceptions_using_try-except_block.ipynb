    "\n",
    "In Python, you can handle exceptions using the `try-except` block. This construct allows you to catch and handle specific exceptions\n",
    "that may occur during the execution of your code. By handling exceptions, you can prevent your program from crashing and provide \n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Syntax of the try-except Block\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try-except` block consists of the `try` block, where you place the code that might raise an exception, and one or more `except` \n",
    "blocks that define how to handle specific exceptions. Here's the basic syntax:"
